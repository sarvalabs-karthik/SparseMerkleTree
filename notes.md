Task-1: Fully Attempted
Task-2: Fully Attempted
Task-3: Fully Attempted
Task-4: Fully Attempted

Following tasks are not efficient but they work functionally: (Both code and tests are present)

Task-5: Fully Attempted (SMT can be made more efficient by choosing better data structure 
like a byte array to represent tree, simillar to Celestia SMT)
Task-6: Partially Attempted (Insert and Remove are implemented
but tree isn't sparse but algorthms are proposed in sparse_mt.md to make it sparse).
